happy birthday max. hope you've been doing well over these past six months, and that monolith is treating you well.

i know you're not the biggest birthday person, so i went onto wikipedia to find some other april 25th related facts/figures. here are some highlights:

1. it's the 115th day of the year (or 116th on a leap year). that means there's only 250 days remaining of this year!
2. on april 26th 1901 new york became the first state to require automobile license plates
3. battle of gallipoli begins in 1915, a ton of countries (including australia) launched an assault on the turkish gallipoli peninsula -- it was a pretty big failure by most accounts. we have public holiday called ANZAC day and people pay their respects and flip coins in a game called two up (it's only legal to play on ANZAC day).
4. in 1983 pioneer 10  travelled beyond the orbit of pluto (rip).
