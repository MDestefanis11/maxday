Dear Max. I may not know you very well or even spent my time on the slack chat but happy birthday! I haven't talked to you a lot nor have been active on this slack. But you matter to everyone else. I might be just a random person who joined the hack club slack and lurk around but others will be there for you. Hope you celebrate with then. have a nice day
